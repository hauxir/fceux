Compiling FCEUX With Emscripten
===============================
By Ryan Moore (github: ryanwmoore)

Emscripten is a project that compiles C/C++ into JavaScript. With Emscripten,
its possible to play FCEUX in your browser. Some browsers (e.g., Firefox)
highly optimize Emscripten's output. For these browsers, performance can be
approximately half the speed of a native compilation.

Steps Overview
--------------

Building FCEUX under Emscripten requires a modern Linux installation. It might
be possible to compile FCEUX using Windows, but this hasn't been investigated.
Compile steps are given assuming you are using bash. The commands may change
slightly if you use a different shell.

To build FCEUX with Emscripten, a few steps must be done:

1) Get Emscripten
2) Compile zlib
3) Compile lua
4) Compile FCEUX

Emscripten automatically provides some libraries (e.g., SDL) and doesn't work
with existing, non-Emscripten libraries on your system. Because of this, it is
normal to see some warnings when compiling. For example, when compiling Lua,
you may see a warning like:

    WARNING root: emcc: cannot find library "m"


Get Emscripten
--------------

There are multiple ways to install Emscripten. It's probably safer just to grab
the latest and greatest from the official site, instead of relying on
potentially outdated packages.

Therefore, follow the Emscripten getting started guide from
http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/

You will need the emsdk-portable.tar.gz installer. Run the update, install
latest, and activate latest commands. Also be sure to setup your environment
according to the guide.

Compile zlib
------------

1) Download zlib's source from http://zlib.net/
2) Extract the source and cd into the directory
3) $ emmake make clean && emmake make

This guide was written/tested using zlib 1.2.8.

Compile lua
-----------

1) Download lua's source from http://www.lua.org
2) Extract the source and cd into the directory
3) $ emmake make clean generic install

This guide was written/tested using lua 5.2.3.

Compile FCEUX
-------------

1) cd into FCEUX's directory
2) Prepare your environment to help FCEUX find your Emscripten-compiled zlib
   and lua libraries:
   $ export CPPPATH="path/to/zlib path/to/lua/install/include"
   $ export LIBPATH="path/to/zlib path/to/lua/install/lib"
2) $ EMCC_FAST_COMPILER=1 emconfigure scons RELEASE=1 GTK=0 LUA=1 SYSTEM_LUA=1 CREATE_AVI=0 OPENGL=0 EMSCRIPTEN=1
